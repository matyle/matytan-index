# Welcome to my site

I am a backend engineer, and I am interested in blockchain, cloud computing, and machine learning.

这里将记录我的学习，工作和生活的一些总结和感悟。

I will record some of my learning, work, and life summaries and insights here.

## Why write blogs and notes?

笔记部分更多的是对知识的**记录和归纳**，一般是作为一个慢慢记录的系列，而博客部分更多的是对生活和学习的感悟，或者突发奇想的好玩的事情。

The notes part is more about the **record and summary** of knowledge, and it is generally a series by recording slowly,
while the blog part is more about the insights into life and learning, or the funny or interesting things that suddenly come to mind.
